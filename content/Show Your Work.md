Writing can be a form of thinking. More so, it captures your thoughts so you may disagree with your own process. It's easy to forget the many thoughts of the day, but the written word remains.

And to write for others is to go outside your usual thoughts. It is to make what's on occasion clear to you transparent for others.

However, at times you'll be opaque as a stained glass window. These are the moments when the attention and care of others are most valuable. Together we make clarity through feedback and iteration.

This is why I write here: so you can tell me how I'm wrong.

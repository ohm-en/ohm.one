Modern operating systems are safe without third-party anti-malware[^1] software. Of course, that's a generalization. In reality, most consumer options are closer to the thing they're trying to prevent: malware. 

While third-party software like Norton or McAfee might seem like a safeguard, they often consume resources and collect data without offering significant advantages over built-in solutions like Windows Defender[^2] or XProtect[^3]. Usually, these built-in services have no installation headache and the best performance without any extra cost.

Additionally, for those with potentially infected files, [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) is a helpful website for scanning suspicious files. It uses several anti-malware services to determine if it's  **known malware** without requiring you to install it.

There are cases where third-party services can provide great value. For instance, places with many untrusted users may require additional security that only a paid service can provide. If you suspect you may need such security, do your research and expect to pay.
